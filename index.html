      <p>Mr. Phileas Fogg lived, in 1872, at No. 7, Saville Row, Burlington
Gardens, the house in which Sheridan died in 1814.  He was one of the
most noticeable members of the Reform Club, though he seemed always to
avoid attracting attention; an enigmatical personage, about whom little
was known, except that he was a polished man of the world.  People said
that he resembled Byron--at least that his head was Byronic; but he was
a bearded, tranquil Byron, who might live on a thousand years without
growing old.</p>

    <h4 class="text-success">Add a clearing element at the bottom of the containing div.</h4>
    <p>This solution is themost straightforward. Simply add a tag—like a line break or horizontal rule—asthe last item in the div containing the floated element (that is, right before the
closing div tag). Then use the clear property to force that extra tag below
the float. This trick makes the enclosing div expand, revealing its background
and border. You cn add a line break br (HTML) or br (XHTML)—before
the closing div tag and add a class to it: br class="clear". Then create
a style for it, like this:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4">
    <div class="thumbnail">
    <a href="image/5.jpg">  
    <img src="image/5.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Green wood 1">
    <div class="caption">
          <p>Lorem ipsum...</p>
    </div>
    </a>
  </div>
  </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="row">  
  <div class="col-sm-8">
    <h4 class="text-success">Float the containing element.</h4>
    <p> An easier way is to just float the div containing
the floated elements as well. A floated container div expands to fully
contain any floated elements inside it. In Figure 13-9, top, the div containing
the heading and two floated columns is floated to the left of the page. In the
process, its entire box—background and borders—expands to fit everything
inside it, including the floated elements. Strange, but true.
If you go this route, make sure you add a clear property to whatever element
follows the floated container to make sure the following element drops below
the container.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4">
    <div class="thumbnail">
    <a href="image/6.jpg">  
    <img src="image/6.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="green wood 2">
    <div class="caption"><p>image 6 </div>
    </a>
    </div>
  </div>

   
</div>

      <div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-8">
    <h4 class="text-success">Use overflow hidden.</h4>
    <p> Another common technique is to add the following two
properties to a style for the containing block:
overflow: hidden;
The overflow:hidden property is just another one of those weird CSS things:
It forces the containing block to expand and contain the floated elements. In
general, this technique works very well. However, if you have any absolutely
positioned elements (see page 410) inside the container, they may not show up.
You can get into this situation if you have a drop-down menu inside another tag
and the drop-downs, when they appear, are supposed to appear outside the
container element. If that’s the case, use one of the other methods described
on these pages.</p>

					With this technique, created by Nicolas Gallagher, you
add just a few styles and a class name to the tag containing the floated element.
This technique is the latest in a long evolution of methods that use the

			<div class="panel panel-info">
				<div class="panel-heading">
					To use it, you add two different styles to your style sheet: One
applies to all modern browsers; the other style applies to IE 7 and earlier. The
whole shebang looks like this

				<div class="panel-heading">
					That outer div grows to be as tall as the tallest element inside it, so even if the maindiv is very tall, that wrapper div will be just as tall. Here’s the magic: Create a stylefor the wrapper div with a background image the width of the sidebar, in thebackground color you want for the sidebar. That way, if the background image tilesvertically, it forms a solid bar the height of the wrapper div (Figure 13-9, top).
